    <div class="w3-card-8 w3-red">In the Minecraft world, Notch added ants to Minecraft. He told everyone it was passive,secretly making it hostile. The first ant was named George. George was as strong as a diamond warrior. Steve saw George and said hello. George was like Bob the zombie and killed Steve in one hit. Suddenly, George had diamond armor in his inventory. He started giving the armor to creepers, spiders, skeletons, zombies, endermen, witches, zombie pigmen, ghasts, magma cubes, wither skeletons, blazes, silverfish, the Ender Dragon, the Wither, and Herobrine. Hostile mobs got more dangerous as they learned to enchant, brew potions, and learn combat. Steve got SCARED and SCARED. He started mining for more diamonds. But  Herobrine stopped Steve and called George to him. Herobrine and George took Steve to prison. But Steve slipped out of Herobrine’s arms. Steve only had iron armor but he killed Herobrine. Steve got Herobrine’s diamond sword. Steve continued mining but a creeper stopped him. “I’ll make lightning strike on me” said the creeper. But Steve finished the creeper off. Steve got a diamond chest plate. Then Steve found the Wither. The boss fight went quick but Steve won. Steve got a diamond helmet. Then Steve found an enderman. He only got ender pearls from the enderman. “No armor?” Steve said. “Thats a shame”. Steve found a skeleton. “Annoying skeletons” Steve said.  Steve went up behind the skeleton and killed it. He got diamond boots. Steve found a zombie. Steve morphed into the Wither. The zombie said hello. Wither Steve fired heads at the zombie. He got an iron ingot. Then he found a spider. He morphed into a pig. “Hello, mysterious pig” said the spider. But Steve the Pig killed the spider. He got string. Steve liked the adventure as he killed diamond-armored monsters. He found a nether portal. He morphed into the Wither again. He went to the Nether and fired heads at zombie pigmen, blazes, magma cubes, ghasts, and wither skeletons. He went back to the real world and killed a slime. Then Steve found a stronghold. The End portal was in front of him. He killed a silverfish and then went to the End. The Ender Dragon said hello to Wither Steve. But Wither Steve had other plans. He fired heads at the Ender Dragon. Steve got diamond leggings. WARNING: the last part contains funny material. Do not die laughing. If you do, its not my fault. Steve found George’s lair. “FINALLY”, said Steve. “Hi, Wither minion” said George. “I’M WITHER STEVE”, said Steve. The boss fight went on for EVER and EVER. “DIE”, said George. “YOU” said Steve. George’s screen suddenly reported ‘You Died!’ FINALLY I BEAT HIM” yelled Steve. Steve went back to his house and called his friends over. “LETS PARTY” said Steve. They partied all night.</div>
